# My dotfiles and housekeeping scripts

You might find some useful things here if you use
- 🍏 macOS
- ⌨️ zsh
- 📝 VS Code
- ⬢ node
- ⚛️ React Native

## Structure
- `./dotfiles/`: config files for many things, installed with `./install/dotfiles.zsh`
- `./install.zsh`: idempotent install script
- `./cleanup.zsh`: get disk space back by cleaning up homebrew, Xcode, yarn...
- `./install/`: ressources for the install script, some can be used independently
- `./notes/`: I take notes in markdown and scripts, you can find some of these here

## Inspired by :
- https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/
And many others that I didn't write down, I will add them to this list when I find them :)
